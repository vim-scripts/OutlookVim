==============================================================================
1. Overview                                        *outlook-overview*

 This plugin has two parts.
 
 Outlook 
 -------
 Outlook includes a feature which allows macros to be created in Visual Basic.
 Once the macro is imported / created, you can create buttons and place them
 on Outlook's toolbars.  The macro (when executed) does several things:
     1.  Writes the email body to a file ending in .outlook 
     2.  Writes out a control file ending in .outlook.ctl 
     3.  Asks Vim to edit the .outlook file
 
 Vim 
 ---
 The outlook.vim plugin is responsible for setting up some autocmds inside 
 of Vim.  There are a number of configuration options which allows you to tweak
 the behaviour of the plugin.  The autocmds also set the Vim filetype to "mail"
 which allows you to customize even further using the usual Vim filetype plugins.
 Setting of the filetype is also an option, you can choose any filetype you wish.
 
 These autocmds are responsible for updating Outlook when the buffer (email) is
 updated.  Communication with Outlook is via the Windows Script Host (WSH
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Script_Host) automation technology from
 Microsoft.
 
 The autocmds will execute the outlookvim.js (Javascript) file which uses 
 the .outlook.ctl file to determine which email to update and places the 
 contents of the .outlook file into the body of the message in Outlook.
 It then deletes these temporary files when finished.
 
 The autocmds also will delete the temporary files if you choose to abandon 
 the changes (in Vim) by using :bdelete, :bwipe or closing Vim.
 
 After creating the Outlook macro and installing the Vim Outlook plugin, no 
 other changes are required except editing and saving your emails.
 
 There are a number of configuration options available see
 |outlook-configuration|
 
 If you have questions or suggestions you can post questions to the Vim mailing
 list.  I routinely monitor the list.  Comments, feedback and suggestions are
 always welcome.

2. What's New                                      *outlook-new*



Version 13.0 (September 28, 2013)

 Bug Fixes
 ---------
 - OutlookVim globally set the textwidth for Vim if g:outlook_textwidth
   is defined, instead of setting the textwidth for the specific email buffer
   opened when editing an email.  The textwidth for the buffer will only be
   set if g:outlook_textwidth is set and > 0 (Antonis Loumiotis).


Version 12.0 (September 6, 2013)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Four new macros have been added for the Outlook toolbars, 
   Compose, Reply, ReplyToAll, Forward.  Unlike the previous Edit macro
   these macros can be used from your Inbox view.  They can be added to the 
   Inbox toolbar and will simply open the selected email items and automatically 
   launch Vim.  These macros support selecting multiple items in your Inbox.
   Compose obviously creates only a single email (Jörn Waterstraat).
 - New option g:outlook_edit_cmd (defaults to "edit") allows you to control
   what command will be used to edit a new email.  For example, if you wanted
   a split at the bottom of Vim, you could set it to 'botright split'.

 Bug Fixes
 ---------
 - In some cases when opening am email in Vim which was in insert mode or having 
   unsaved text it was possible for the text to be overwritten (Gary Johnson).


Version 11.0 (June 15, 2013)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Changed how the filetype is set for Outlook.  The g:outlook_file_type
   will be used for all mail.  If g:outlook_supported_body_format = 'html'
   and the buffer begins with the html tag the filetype will be set to 'html'.

 Bug Fixes
 ---------
 - g:outlook_supported_body_format was not checked in the Outlook macro, 
   a previous variable name was used (Gary Johnson).


Version 10.0 (May 31, 2013)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Editing HTML formated Outlook emails is now supported.  A new option 
   has been added, g:outlook_supported_body_format, can have one of two 
   values: plain or html.
   NOTE: Outlook html contains a lot of markup tags.  It can make it difficult
         to find the body text within all the tags.
 - A new option has been added, g:outlook_file_type, which defaults to 'mail'.
   When opening the buffer within Vim, this file type is set for the buffer.
   You may want to change this value if you are editing HTML emails.
 - A new command has been added: OutlookNewEmail.  This will take the contents
   of the existing buffer and create a new Outlook email.  If the filetype 
   is 'html' and g:outlook_supported_body_format = 'html', the email body 
   will be html rather than plain text.  The command can be run as often as
   necessary, a new Outlook email will be created each time.

 Bug Fixes
 ---------
 - The additional changes to the VB code to support both 32-bit and
   64-bit platforms does not work with Outlook 2007 32-bit (at least).
   The new changes will work for either (Greg Dunn).


Version 9.0 (May 12, 2013)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Added new option, g:outlook_always_use_Unicode, to override Outlook and
   force all emails to use utf-16le fileencoding.
 - Added new option, g:outlook_scan_email_body_Unicode, to override whether
   messages will be scanned for Unicode characters.
 - Added new option, g:outlook_debug, to turn on messages displayed to both 
   Outlook and Vim.
 - Updated some of the messages displayed to be more informative.

 Bug Fixes
 ---------
 - Editing Unicode emails did not reliably work with OutlookVim.
 - Unicode detection was not always correct in the Outlook Basic file.
 - Updated the codepage which Vim expects Unicode messages from Outlook 
   to be encoded in (András).
 - Added some additional changes to the VB code to support both 32-bit and
   64-bit platforms (Paul).


Version 8.0 (February 1, 2013)

 New Features
 ------------
 - When preparing to edit an email in Vim, OutlookVim.bas will query the
   Vim instance checking to see if multi_byte support is enabled in Vim.
   It does this by checking to see if a bomb is enabled (:set bomb) 
   and the value of fileencodings (:set fileencodings) to see if ucs-bom or
   any utf strings have been specified.  If multi_byte is enabled, then the 
   file created by OutlookVim.bas will be saved in Unicode.  If your Vim is 
   not setup to edit Unicode files, Outlook will not enable the Unicode format.


Version 7.0 (October 10, 2012)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Added support for Outlook 2010.
 - Added documentation on how to self sign the Outlook Vim macro so that 
   security settings do not have to change in Outlook to use the macro.
   Changing these settings are not possible in some companies.


Version 6.0 (February 21, 2012)

 Bug Fix
 -------
 - Changed how the script looks for some system files especially useful if you 
   do not store your vimfiles directory in the $VIM directory (Adam Duck).


Version 5.0 (August 14, 2010)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Changed how the script looks for some system files especially useful if you 
   do not store your vimfiles directory in the $VIM directory (Adam Duck).


Version 4.0 (June 4, 2010)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Updated documentation.  Added a troubleshooting section (Zsolt Botykai).
 - Updated outlookvim.js to display a message if double clicked on to determine 
   if Windows Script Host is correctly installed.
 - Updated outlookvim.bas (the Outlook VBScript Macro) to show an error if it 
   cannot access the file system.  Modified all the message boxes Outlook may
   display to indicate "OutlookVim:" is displaying the message.
 - You can specify whether new emails should be opened in a new tab via 
   the g:outlook_use_tabs configuration option (Zsolt Botykai).


Version 3.0 (May 10, 2010)

 New Features
 ------------
 - You can specify which Vim instance to edit the file by setting a variable
   in your .vimrc (i.e. let g:outlook_servername = 'OUTLOOK')
 
 Bug Fixes
 ---------
 - For some (international?) Windows versions, there were errors when (or a
   failure) editing the file.  Needed to escape the backslashes of the filename.


Version 2.0 (May 7, 2010)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Working with Outlook 2007 and first official release.
 - Documentation updates.


Version 1.0 (May 7, 2010)

 New Features
 ------------
 - Initial release.


==============================================================================
3. Installing the Plugin                           *outlook-install*

 You can use this script as a plugin by copying it to your plugin directory. 
 See |add-global-plugin| for instructions.
 
 You can also |:source| it from your |.vimrc|.

 To install this help file |add-local-help| inside Vim.
    :help add-local-help
    :helptags $VIM/vimfiles/doc (Windows)

 Files used by the plugin:
    outlook.vim
        - Sets up autocmds which are activated when editing a file
          which ends in .outlook
    outlookVim.bas
        - Visual Basic code used by Outlook to create some temporary files
          and launch Vim.
    outlookVim.js
        - A Javascript file called by the Vim autocmds when the file is saved.
          It uses Outlook APIs to update the email within Outlook.
    outlook.txt
        - This document

 NOTE:
     Vim must be in nocompatible mode for the plugin to operate correctly.
     This implies you have this line in your |.vimrc|: >
        set nocompatible 
<

==============================================================================
4. Installing the Outlook Macro                    *outlook-macro*

 The macro is used to add a button in Outlook to launch Vim.  It is used to
 create the files which Vim will edit.  It will also add a shortcut key
 (Alt-d) to fire up Vim instead of having to use a mouse.

 To install the Outlook macro open Outlook.

  1.  Macro security
        Outlook 2003
             - From the Outlook menu Tools->Macro->Security 
             - Make sure this is set to Medium, or the macro will not be enabled 
        Outlook 2007
             - From the Outlook menu Tools->Macro->Security 
             - Make sure this is set to Warnings for all macros
        Outlook 2010
             - From the Outlook menu File -> Options 
                 -> Trust Center (left pane) 
                 -> Trust Center Settings (Button, right pane)
                 -> Macro Settings
             - Depending on what security settings your company enforces you 
               can either "Enable all macros" or choose "Notifications for all
               macros" and you will be prompted once each time Outlook is
               started.
             - See step 16 below.
  2.  From the menu Tools->Macro->Visual Basic Editor (or Alt-F11)
      - For Outlook 2010, I had to restart Outlook with Admin rights 
        by holding down CTRL-SHIFT when I clicked on the Outlook icon.
  3.  From the menu File->Import File (or Ctrl-M)
  4.  Choose the file ...\vimfiles\plugin\OutlookVim.bas (depending on where you
      installed the plugin).
  5.  Expand the Modules folder in the Project pane

               "Customize"
             - Choose the Commands tab 
             - Click on the Macros category
             - Drag and drop the Vim.Edit macro onto the end of the Standard 
               toolbar displayed in the currently open email 
             - Click on the Rearrange Commands button 
             - Change the radio button to Toolbar: Standard 
             - Scroll to the bottom where the Vim.Edit button is and highlight it
             - Click on the Modify Selection button
             - On the dropdown which appears, click on Name
             - Change the name from "Vim.Edit" to "Vim.E&dit" 
                - Now you can press Alt-d as a shortcut to launch Vim to edit 
                  the email without having to use the mouse to click on the 
                  button (after all, that is the Vim way)
             - Hit Enter, Close and Close to return back to the open email
             - Click on the Vim.Edit button, or hit Ctrl-d to edit the email using Vim
        Outlook 2007
             - Toolbars are not editable in Outlook 2007
             - A new Quick Access Toolbar has been introduced in the titlebar
               of the open email
             - Click on the far right of the toolbar and choose "Customize
               Quick Access Toolbar" 
             - Click on "More Commands..."
             - Change the "Choose commands from" to "Macros"

             - Hit Ok
             - Click on the new button you added in the Quick Access Toolbar
 13.  Make a minor change to the email (in Vim) and :w
 14.  Verify the Outlook email has the same change 
 15.  Hit Escape to close the Outlook email, you will be prompted to Save 
      the changes you have just made.  So you always have an option of 
      cancelling the changes you made in Vim, in Outlook.
 16.  Creating a digital certificate and signing your macro.
      By default Outlook will not open certificates that are not digitally
      signed.
      There are some simple instructions which you can follow using 
      Microsoft Office Tools (since you already have Outlook) to:
         a)  Create a personal certificate.  
         b)  Use this certificate to sign the VB macro.
         c)  Add this certificate to your CA Root Certificates.
      This should allow you to leave the default macro settings as they 
      are and still have the Vim.Edit macro function.
      This site was very useful:
            http://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/selfcert.htm
      After you have digitally signed the Vim.Edit certificate start 
      Outlook.
      When Outlook launches it will prompt you with a Microsoft Office
      Security Notice.  "Warning this publisher has not been authenticated
      and therefore could be imitated.  Do not trust these credentials."
      Below that says "ThisOutlookSession", which when we added the 
      OutlookVim.bas to the VB editor you would have seen ...

      Click on the link, "Show Signature Details".   The "Signer information"
      should be the name you created using Microsoft Office Tools.

      Click on the "View Certificate" button.

      The "Issued to" and "Issued by" should be the same name.

      Click on the "Install Certificate" button.  The Certificate Import Wizard
      will start up.  Take defaults ("Always select the certificate store
      based on the type of certificate").

      When the wizard finishes, choose "Trust all documents from this
      publisher).

      Restart Outlook, you should not be prompted again to for the Vim.Edit 
      macro, and it should be enabled.

      To view where your new certificate has been installed (or to remove it)
      on Windows 7, you can run CertMgr.msc
      (http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows-vista/View-or-manage-your-certificates)
      and from the menu, Action -> Find Certificates ..., type in the name
      of your certificate.

 More Macros
      In OutlookVim 12.0, four additional macros have been added:
          Compose    - Create a new email and edit in Vim 
          Reply      - Reply to the current selected items and edit in Vim
          ReplyToAll - ReplyAll to the current selected items and edit in Vim
          Forward    - Forward the current selected items and edit in Vim

      You can add these macros directly to your toolbar when viewing your
      Inbox versus an open email.  
          Outlook 2003
             - Not sure, don't have it installed, but it should be very
               similar to the previous directions.
          Outlook 2007
             - Not sure, don't have it installed, but it should be very
               similar to the previous directions.
          Outlook 2010
             - Right click on the far right of the toolbar and choose 
               "Customize the Ribbon" 
             - Change the "Choose commands from" to "Macros"
             - In the right pane, under "Main Tabs", create a New Group (hit
               button at bottom)
             - Click the Rename button and call the new group whatever you like (Vim?)
             - Make sure this new group is highlighted
             - Add the following macros, Vim.Compose, Vim.Reply,
               Vim.ReplyToAll, Vim.Forward using the "Add >>" button
             - Click on each new macro added to the Vim group in the right
               pane and click the "Rename" button beside the "Add Group" button
             - Here you can assign some icon to it that will be easily 
               recognisable, but you can _also_ rename the macro and in these
               cases, I would strip of the "Vim." part, since we already
               created the group called "Vim", so it is redundant.
             - Hit Ok
             - In your Inbox, you can either highlight an individual email or
               you can use Control+Click and select multiple items.  Then hit
               the Vim Reply button.
             - Test out the buttons and see how they work in your Inbox.

==============================================================================
5. Configuration                                   *outlook-configuration*

 The behavior of outlook.vim is governed by several variables. These variables
 are used both by the autocmds which are created by the plugin and to configure 
 your own customization of this plugin.  These variables can be assigned
 global defaults which can be set in your |.vimrc|. 

 You can override many of the features of this script by creating various
 variables within your vimrc.
                                                                          
 By default all emails will be opened using the standard Vim :edit command
 (see g:outlook_edit_cmd).  For users, who prefer using tabs in Vim, this
 setting (default = 0) will force all emails to be edited in a new tab in Vim.  >
     let g:outlook_use_tabs = 1
<
 By default, all emails will be edited in which ever Vim instance is running 
 the OLE server (a user cannot determine this) and only 1 Vim instance can 
 be the OLE server.  Different users use Vim in different ways.  Some prefer 
 to have only 1 instance open with multiple buffers.  Some prefer 1 instance 
 and using tabs for each buffer.  Other have a mixture of practices.  
 To accommodate how people work, you can also assign a specific Vim instance 
 to be used just to edit mail.  This setting (default = '') will force all
 emails to be edited in a particular Vim instance.  If the instance has not be
 started, a message is displayed with an example command line to start an
 appropriate Vim. >
     let g:outlook_servername = ''
<
 OutlookVim uses a few commands to edit a new email.  If Vim was just launched
 and has only 1 buffer which has not been modified, it will simply ":edit" the
 file.  If g:outlook_use_tabs is enabled, it uses ":tabnew".  If the current
 buffer is not modified, it will use ":edit".  If the current buffer is
 modified and nohidden is set, then it will use ":split".  For customization
 purposes, you can override this command and use your own Vim command by 
 setting the following in your |.vimrc|: >
     let g:outlook_edit_cmd = 'botright split'
<
 This setting (default = plain) indicates which format of the Outlook message
 to use when creating the buffer for Vim to edit.  If the value is set to
 "html", then if the Outlook email is using an "html" body, then the buffer 
 will contain html code.  If the email is in rich text or plain text, then 
 the buffer will be in plain text.  So you will only edit in html, if the 
 body of the Outlook message is already in html.  To set this preference 
 add the following to your .vimrc: >
     let g:outlook_supported_body_format = 'html'
<
 By default OutlookVim sets the file type for a buffer to be either "mail"
 or if you are editing a HTML formatted mail to "html".  For customization 
 purposes you can override this behaviour and set it to any value you 
 would like: >
     let g:outlook_file_type = 'anything_you_like'
<
 If needed, this setting allows you to override the default textwidth for the 
 filetype chosen for your email.  By creating this variable each new email
 opened in Vim will set a local buffer option to this value.  This will
 allow you to automatically format text using gq.  If this variable 
 = 0, changing the buffer specific textwidth is abandoned: >
     let g:outlook_textwidth = 76
<
 When you save a file, by default, Outlook will be updated and the temporary
 file you are editing will be deleted.  Autoread was added so that the Vim
 buffer is automatically cleared instead of displaying a warning message
 indicating the file has changed outside of Vim (in fact it was deleted).  If
 you wish to see the warning, you can set (default = 1) the following: >
     let g:outlook_noautoread = 1
<                                                                    
 When you save a file, by default, Outlook will be updated and the temporary
 file you are editing will be deleted.  Since the file has been deleted, you
 are left editing a file that no longer exists.  By default, the Vim buffer
 will be deleted automatically, unless this option (default = 1) is set. 
 If you want to be able to save the file multiple times before removing the
 buffer from Vim, set the following: >
     let g:outlook_nobdelete = 1
<
 If you do not save the temporary file and instead decide to throw away your

 In order to edit Outlook emails which contain Unicode characters in the body
 of the email you must enable UTF support in Vim. Your Vim setting must
 include a font capable of displaying the characters and your encodings must
 support UTF.  To check these items, you can run the following in Vim:
    1.  Does your Vim support multi_byte? >
        :echo has("multi_byte")  
        1
<   2.  Does your fileencodings support multi_byte 
        (usc-bom or utf-8 or utf-16le)? >
        :echo match(&fileencodings, '\<ucs-bom\|utf\>')
        0  (or greater)
<   3.  Does your encoding support multi_byte (utf-8 or utf-16le)? >
        :echo match(&encoding, '\<utf\>')
        0  (or greater)
<   4.  For your font, make sure you choose one which will correctly 
        display your characters.  DejaVu fonts 
        (http://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu/) will work. 
        If you install these fonts, adding the following in your .vimrc
        will enable them: >
            set guifont=DejaVu_Sans_Mono:h11:b:cANSI
<
 The following settings in my .vimrc allowed me to successfully view 
 and edit Unicode text from Outlook: >
     if has("multi_byte")  
         set encoding=utf-8
         set fileencodings=ucs-bom
         set guifont=DejaVu_Sans_Mono:h11:b:cANSI
     endif
<
 By default OutlookVim does not enable Unicode when writing the file which 
 Vim will edit.  It does check the Outlook body of the message to see if 
 there are any Unicode characters.  If there are Unicode characters present, 
 it will enable Unicode.  If you know you routinely edit emails with Unicode 
 characters, then you should tell OutlookVim to always write the files it
 creates using Unicode.  If you are in North America, where you most likely
 never deal with Unicode characters then you probably do not have Vim setup to
 edit Unicode files.  Leaving the OutlookVim defaults is probably best for
 North Americans.  If your Vim has the required Unicode support you can force
 Outlook to always use Unicode format using this settings: >
     let g:outlook_always_use_Unicode = 1
<
 There could be a performance penalty when scanning the body of an email to
 check for Unicode characters if you frequently edit very large emails.
 Setting outlook_always_use_Unicode = 1 will prevent this scan since there is
 no reason to scan if we are always using Unicode.  Turning off the check for
 Unicode characters means you could open the file in Vim using an encoding
 which does not support the Unicode characters.  When saving the file and
 updating the Outlook body with the saved text, all Unicode characters will be
 changed.  So BEWARE if you are disabling this check.  To disable the scan
 when outlook_always_use_Unicode = 0 with: >
     let g:outlook_scan_email_body_Unicode = 0
<

6.  Troubleshooting (various versions of Windows)  *outlook-troubleshooting*

 If you're Outlook macro does not work at all (or opens a Vim (GUI) window
 but without proper contents/filename), you should check your Internet
 Explorer's security settings.
 
 Go to IE => Tools => Options => Security tab => Custom level and check if the
 various ActiveX components are allowed to run. 
 
 If they are enabled, and the Outlook macro still does not work, your Windows
 Script Host (WSH) might not be installed correctly.  To test this, open Windows 
 Explorer (not Internet Explorer) and navigate to where your Vim plugins 
 are installed.  Find the plugin\OutlookVim.js file and double click on it.
 This will launch the Javascript file and a Message Box should popup saying: >
     "Hello from OutlookVim!"
< 
 If the Message Box is not displayed or some other error is displayed, your
 Windows Script Host (WSH) might not be installed correctly.  You may want to
 reinstall WSH by following the Upgrade links found at the WSH home page. >
     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9bbdkx3k.aspx
< 
 The following has solved the problem for at least one user on a Windows XP
 system using Outlook 2003.  Re-registering the Windows Script Host's DLLs.  
 Hit the *Win+R* keyboard combination and run these 2 commands (separately): >
     regsvr32 wshom.ocx
     regsvr32 scrrun.dll
<
 If the above does not help, or if you receive an error message when running
 the two commands above, then you may need to contact Microsoft Support.
